@# Overlay
An overlay is composed of a `Portal` component that allows for content to be rendered on top of it's siblings. By default, a `Overlay` will render it's content to an element appended to `document.body`. A `Overlay` is a controlled component and can only be toggled via the `isOpen` attribute.
